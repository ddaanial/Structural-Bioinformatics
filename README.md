These are some procedures to work with protein pdb file in tcl language:

  Sequence of different frame:
         Procedure to write the sequence of different model (frame) structures of the protein in an output file and calculate the percentage of each type of secondary structure for the models.




  Phi and Psi:
         Procedure to Calculate the phi and psi angles for a protein model.



  RMSD Matrix:
        Procedure to load the pdb file, calculate the pairwise RMSD matrix for all frames of the protein, and write it in an output file.



  Atoms involved in hydrogen bonding:
         Procedure to output the following for atoms involved in hydrogen bonding: amino acid number, amino acid name, type of secondary structure, dihedral angles (phi, psi, omega), and the radius of gyration.
